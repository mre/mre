### Ohai!

* 🌊 I'm building [analysis-tools.dev](https://analysis-tools.dev/) and host [Hello Rust](https://hello-rust.show/).
* 🧦 Writing about Rust, Vim, silly web experiments (and socks!) on [endler.dev](https://endler.dev/)
* 🐠 [Talking about Rusty things](https://endler.dev/talks/) at meetups and conferences like FOSDEM, RustBeltRust, Codemotion, and RustFest.
* 😧 Maintaining >100 projects here on Github. [Show my mum that this is not a waste of time](https://github.com/sponsors/mre/).
