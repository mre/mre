Hi, I'm Matthias Endler! ðŸª´

I'm based in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, and work as a Rust consultant at [corrode](https://corrode.dev/). I maintain [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee), a high-performance link checker, and mostly write about [Rust](https://corrode.dev/blog/) and [indie development](https://endler.dev/).
